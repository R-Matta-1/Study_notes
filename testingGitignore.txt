%%So I'm at work right and im doing two jobs for at least the course of two hours. Im doing two jobs. And I realized that there are two people outside who are just not on headset and could be doing one of those jobs. And I say, hey, we should bring 1 of those people inside. But whatever. Anyway, then they say, no, we are doing fine. We are doing fine. We don't need to bring them inside. It's better if they are outside Yeah, it's better.but only because, because I've been doing two jobs, busting my ass for the past two hours, and they don't recognized it. No. Do they think they do more work than me? Abb, so lutely.                             And that's not even the end of it. Because while I'm doing two jobs, I think, oh, everyone else is going to be closing. We're going to get out of here so quickly because everyone is so studious, especially because I'm helping them out by doing two jobs and I look around at what has everyone been doing,And I realized that these people are so amazingly lazy that they've just been ignoring all the time they've had. They say, and they think of themselves, oh, look, we have so much free time. More closing is going to be great. But then they don't do anything with that free time. Idiots                                                At least I'm getting a letter of recommendation out of this place
