# understanding units?

$\text{Period}=\frac{1}{\text{Frequency}}=\frac{1}{\frac{300
\text{ billion birds}}{4\pi\times\text{Earth radius}^2}\times
1\frac{\frac{\text{poop}}{\text{bird}}}{\text{hour}}\times16\frac{\text{hours}}{\text{day}}\times
1 \frac{\text{mouth}}{\text{poop}}\times 15 \frac{\text{
cm}^2}{\text{mouth}}}=195\text{ years}$

 XKCD found the awnser for the question "if your mouth is open and you are still, how long till a bird poops in it?"
